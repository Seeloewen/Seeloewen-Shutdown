With Seeloewen Shutdown you can schedule automatic shutdowns or restarts. The timer is fully customizable and editable after an action was already started. You can either choose "In ... seconds/minutes/hours" or a direct point in time. It can also detect if an action was already started and remember the past executed actions.

The settings allow you to customize the software the way you like. Toggle notifications, change the design and the language, toggle Action History and edit profiles.

The app also has profiles, which makes it easy to save and load presets!
It also features in-app notifications was well as a 'Minimalistic View'-Mode. This only shows the necessary contents when activated, like the timer and when exactly the software will execute the action.

You can also choose to delay the shutdown if certain processes are running. You can choose these processes either by writing them down or selecting them from a list.

If you need help or have any questions you can contact Seeloewen on Discord.

## A bit of history

In late 2020 and early 2021 I was playing on a vanilla Minecraft server with my friends. We had a lot of auto farms which would require someone to stay afk. Because I didn't want to spend my daytime standing next to a farm I decided to do it at night. But I also didn't want to have my computer running all night, so I researched a bit and found out that there are commands that you can execute in a command prompt which will shutdown the computer after a specific time. I used that command for a while until I thought of something. "Why not make a GUI for it?" - And thats what I did. I only had a little coding experience in VB.NET back then but it was enough and so on 28th October 2020 I finished the first version 0.1. I updated it over the time and added more features, changed a bunch of things and fixed many issues. And thats what I still do today. 

Fun fact: After version 0.4 I had to reset my PC and forgot to back up the files, so I had to recode the entire software. Fortunately, I could get some of the code back using decompilers (I still had the executables from older versions.) That's why there was a big break between version 0.4 and 1.0 (almost 5 months) but after I got all the code back I started working more actively on it. I also shared it with my friends, who gave me a lot of valuable feedback. 

When I had finished version 1.4 I decided that the software was stable enough to be released to the public. And that's how Seeloewen Shutdown was made. I will not release any versions older than 1.6.1 as I don't think they are stable enough to be publicly used. Most of them are broken due to changes in the updater and stuff and they contained a lot of bugs. You will see a changelog in the software which goes back all the way to version 0.1 though.
