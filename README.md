# Seeloewen-Shutdown

With Seeloewen Shutdown you can choose when your PC will automatically shutdown or restart. The time when it shuts down is fully customizable. You can either choose "in ... seconds/minutes/hours" or direct point in time. You can also attach a message to action, if you want to.

The settings allow you to save an action, a point in time and a message that will automatically be loaded and selected if you start the programm. You can also update the software in the settings, which makes it easy to stay up-to-date. And If you already have an action running that you want to cancel, you can do that here!

If you need help you can open the "help" window, which shows a more detailed explanation on the features. If you need further help or have any questions you can also contact Seeloewen#5699 on Discord.

# Why did I make this software?

In late 2020 and early 2021 I was playing on a vanilla Minecraft server with my friends. We had a lot of auto farms which would require someone to stand afk. Because I didn't want to spend my daytime standing next to a farm I decided to do it at night. But I also didn't wanna have my computer running all night, so I searched a bit on google and found out that there are commands that you can execute in a command prompt which will shutdown the computer after a specific time. So I used that command for a while until I thought of something. "Why not make a GUI for it?" And thats what I did. I only had a little coding experience in VB.NET but it was enough and so on October 28th 2020 I finished the first version 0.1. I updated it over the time and added more features. And thats what I still do today. When I had finished version 1.4 I decided that the software was stable enough to be released to the public. And that's how Seeloewen Shutdown was made. I will not release any versions older than 1.4 as I don't think they are stable enough to be publicly used Most of them are broken due to changes in the updater and stuff and the contained a lot of bugs. You will see a changelog in the software which goes back all the way to version 0.1.
